this example is from AvoidDowncasts - Correct Application.

The misapplication showed why the concrete routers must be placed in bill.jar (to avoid AcyclicRelationships). But it violates CohesiveModules since evolution dictates changes in two places whenever the Router is changed. So we move the concrete routers to the route.jar, but must introduce a new element (PrioritizedRouter) to decouple router.jar from bill.jar. Note that bill supports SeparateAbstractions, but that Router does not. This is mainly because bill will evolve separately from router, whereas the concrete routers evolve similarly. The intent of what we're trying to accomplish is a bit different here. Now, we're more concerned with CohesiveCOmponents, since it's doubtful we'll create new Routers and plug them into the system, though we certainly could. On the flip side, we do have Bill separated from Routable, which does support SeparateAbstractions.
